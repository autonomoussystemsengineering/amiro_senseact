====== MuRoX Converter ======

In this folder, the MuRoX converter which are used to reach minimal overhead, are stored.
In all other situations, the standard [[includes:types:start|MuRoX Types]] or [[http://docs.cor-lab.de//rst-manual/trunk/html/data-types.html|RST types]] should be used.
To build the converter, just add them to your ''CMakeLists.txt'' file as follows:

<file CMaKeLists.txt>
  ...
  # Add folders to build and run CMakeLists.txt in it
  if (NOT TARGET vecIntConverter)
    add_subdirectory (../../includes/converter/vecIntConverter lib/vecIntConverter)
  endif()
  ...
  target_link_libraries (
    ...
    vecIntConverter
  )
  ...
)
</file> 

The usage of such converter can be seen in [[sense:senseCam:start|senseCam]].
There exist also template converter like the ''vecConverter'', which do not need to be precompiled (See [[tools:misc:sendRandomIntVector:start|sendRandomIntVector]] for an example).
