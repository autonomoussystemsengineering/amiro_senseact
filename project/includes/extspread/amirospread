# Spread options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Set what internal Spread events are logged to the screen or file 
# (see EventLogFile).
# Default setting is to enable PRINT and EXIT events only. 
#The PRINT and EXIT types should always be enabled. The names of others are:
#        EXIT PRINT DEBUG DATA_LINK NETWORK PROTOCOL SESSION 
#    CONFIGURATION MEMBERSHIP FLOW_CONTROL STATUS EVENTS 
#    GROUPS MEMORY SKIPLIST ALL NONE    
#    ALL and NONE are special and represent either enabling every type 
#                                           or enabling none of them.
#    You can also use a "!" sign to negate a type, 
#        so { ALL !DATA_LINK } means log all events except data_link ones.

# DebugFlags = { PRINT EXIT }

# Set priority level of events to output to log file or screen
# The possible levels are: 
#    pDEBUG INFO WARNING ERROR CRITICAL FATAL
# Once selected all events tagged with that priority or higher will
# be output. FATAL events are always output and cause the daemon to 
# shut down. Some Events are tagged with a priority of PRINT which
# causes them to print out no matter what priority level is set. 
#
# The default level used if nothing is set is INFO.
    
#EventPriority =  INFO

#Set whether to log to a file as opposed to stdout/stderr and what 
# file to log to.
# Default is to log to stdout.
#
#If option is not set then logging is to stdout.
#If option is set then logging is to the filename specified.
# The filename can include a %h or %H escape that will be replaced at runtime
# by the hostname of the machine upon which the daemon is running.
# For example "EventLogFile = spreadlog_%h.log" with 2 machines 
# running Spread (machine1.mydomain.com and machine2.mydomain.com) will
# cause the daemons to log to "spreadlog_machine1.mydomain.com.log" and
# "spreadlog_machine2.mydomain.com.log" respectively.

#EventLogFile = testlog.out

#Set whether to add a timestamp in front of all logged events or not.
# Default is no timestamps. Default format is "[%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S]".
#If option is commented out then no timestamp is added.
#If option is enabled then a timestamp is added with the default format
#If option is enabled and set equal to a string, then that string is used
#   as the format string for the timestamp. The string must be a valid time
#   format string as used by the strftime() function.

#EventTimeStamp
# or
#EventTimeStamp = "[%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S]"

#Set whether to add a precise (microsecond) resolution timestamp to all logged
# events or not. This option requires that EventTimeStamp is also enabled. 
# If the option is commented out then the microsecond timestamp is not added
# If the option is uncommented then a microsecond time will print in addition
#  to the H:M:S resolution timestamp provided by EventTimeStamp. 

#EventPreciseTimeStamp

# Set to initialize daemon sequence numbers to a 'large' number for testing
# this is purely a debugging capability and should never be enabled on
# production systems (note one side effect of enabling this is that 
# your system will experience an extra daemon membership every few messages
# so you REALLY do not want this turned on)
# If you want to change the initial value the sequence number is set to
# you need to edit the #define INITIAL_SEQUENCE_NEAR_WRAP at the top
# of configuration.h

#DebugInitialSequence

#Set whether to allow dangerous monitor commands 
# like "partition, flow_control, or kill"
# Default setting is FALSE.
#If option is set to false then only "safe" monitor commands are allowed 
#    (such as requesting a status update).
#If option is set to true then all monitor commands are enabled. 
#   THIS IS A SECURTIY RISK IF YOUR NETWORK IS NOT PROTECTED!

DangerousMonitor = true

#Set handling of SO_REUSEADDR socket option for the daemon's TCP
# listener.  This is useful for facilitating quick daemon restarts (OSes
# often hold onto the interface/port combination for a short period of time
# after daemon shut
