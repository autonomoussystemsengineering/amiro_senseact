====== showCamIpl ======

This application greps ''cv::Mat'' images from a RSB scope and displays them.
See the demo [[demo:cameraJpeg:start|Sending and displaying of camera images]] for a similar setup, but for generating the frames for this particular program, see [[sense:senseCam::start|senseCam]].
