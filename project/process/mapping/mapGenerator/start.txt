====== Mapgenerator ======

This program takes the position and the current ring proximity values and builds a map from them.
It also receives signals from the frontier exploration to add the edges of the table to the map.
During mapbuilding MapUpdates are published to update the map of other robots participating in the exploration and to update showMap.
The Mapgenerator also sets up a rsb-server to which other programs can send requests to get the map or to plan paths in the map.


An initial map can be loaded with the ''-l [filename]'' command line option.

|/edgePose | Inscope for edge positions relative to the robot|
|/enableMapGenerator | Inscope (boolean) to pause/unpause mapbuilding |
|/saveMap | Inscope for receiving filenames to save the obstacle map |
|/saveEdgeMap | Inscope for receiving filenames to save the edge map |
|/mapUpdate | Scope for receiving and sending MapUpdates |
|/mapGenerator | Scope of the rsb-server. Methods: getMap, getObstacleMap, getFrontierPath, getPath, getPushingPath|
