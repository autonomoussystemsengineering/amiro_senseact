====== Object Delivery ======

Given the [[process:mapping:mapGenerator:start|mapGenerator]] and [[process:exploration:localPlanner:start|localPlanner]] programs are running this program makes the robot deliver any object that can be found in the environment (by the mapGenerator program) when it is requested for delivery (e.g. by a state machine) via RSB. This object will be approached and delivered by pushing it to a predefined position (place destination marker before start!). Therefore, a "pushing path" is requested from the mapGenerator and decomposed into its straight segments along which the object is consecutively pushed.

===== Color Codes =====

Yellow: Pushing.
Green: Delivered.

===== Building =====

This is a cmake project, so just type:
  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''

===== RSB Scopes =====

For communication with the state machine the following RSB scopes are defined:

^ Name ^ Type ^ Default scope ^ Description ^
| Command scope | String | "/objectDelivery/command" | Scope for receiving commands. |
| Answer scope | String | "/objectDelivery/answer" | Scope for sending commands. |

===== Requesting an Object =====

An object is requested by publishing it on the command scope as a twbTracking::proto::Pose2D (x and y position, orientation).

===== Parameters =====

For parameter information type ''objectDelivery -h''.

^ Parameter ^ Type ^ Default Value ^ Description ^
| --robotID | Integer | 0 | ID of robot for communication (default=0). |
| --id | Integer | 0 | ID of the tracking marker. |
| --destId | Integer | 4 | ID of the destination marker. |
| --positionInscope | String | "/localization" | Inscope for position data of SLAM localization. |
| --pathRe | String | "/pathResponse" | Inscope for path responses. |
| --pathOut | String | "/path" | Outscope for the robots path. |
| --mapServer | String | "/mapGenerator" | Scope for the mapGenerator server. |
| --host | String | "localhost" | Host for Programatik Spread. |
| --port | String | "4823" | Port for Programatik Spread. |
| --meterPerPixel, mpp | Float | 1/400 | Camera parameter: Meter per Pixel. |
| --debugVis | bool | false | Debug mode: object selection via keyboard & visualization. |
| --bigMap | bool | false | Flag if the map is very big (the pathplanner needs more than 25 seconds). |
| --mapServerIsRemote | bool | false | Flag, if the map server is a remote server (otherwise it uses local connection). |
| --useSLAMData | bool | false | Use SLAM Localization Data (PoseEuler) instead of Tracking Data for incomming position data. |
