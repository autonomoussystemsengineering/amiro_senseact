====== edgeApproachBehavior ======

Turns towards and approach black edge detected by the side proximity sensors until front sensor detects it, too. Do nothing if no edge it detected at all.
Meant to work with [[act:motorControl:start|motorControl]] as a continously produced behavior with a certain priority (to be set) which might get overwritten by another higher prioritized behavior.
(Attention: Proximity sensor values are normalized in hard-coded way, check if up-to-date!)

===== Parameters =====

For parameter information type ''edgeApproachBehavior -h''.

^ Parameter ^ Type ^ Default Value ^ Description ^
