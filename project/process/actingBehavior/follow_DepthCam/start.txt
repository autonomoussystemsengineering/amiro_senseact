====== Following Procedure via Depth Camera ======

This program contains a following procedure via depth camera.

===== Basic Procedure =====

The robot is given a sector range, where it should focus on objects in the depth image of the depth camera only. The sector is ranged by a minimal and a maximal distance. Independently of the object's measured distance, the robot tries to get the highest position of the object in the image into the center of the image.

By adjusting the camera angle, very different driving behaviors can be the outcome.

===== Communication =====

By sending commands via RSB, the following procedure can activated and deactivated (it cannot be quit!):

^ Command ^ Scope Name ^ Description ^
| init | Command Scope | The robot will initialize and start the following procedure. |
| stop | Command Scope | The robot will stop the following procedure. |

===== RSB Scopes =====

There are different RSB scopes for the following procedure:

^ Scope Name ^ Scope (on default) ^ Description ^
| Command Scope | /following    | Scope for receiving start and stop commands. |
| Image Scope   | /images/rgb   | Scope for sending the RGB and depth image of the depth camera. |
| Light Scope   | /amiro/lights | Scope for sending light commands. |
