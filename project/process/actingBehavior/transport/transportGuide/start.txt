====== Transport Guide ======

This tool is the guide behavior of the transport scenario, which is described in the [[process:transport:start|transport documentation]]. Basically the robot guides another robot to the final transport position.

===== Building =====

This is a cmake project, so just type:
  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''

===== Basic Functionality in the Scenario =====

  - "Waiting" (doing some basic behavior)
  - Receiving start position
  - Transmits OK (as recognition)
  - Receiving position of other robot (now called Transporter)
  - Driving to start position (maybe driving around the Transporter)
  - Transmits OK (as arrival signal)
  - Receiving final transport position
  - Calculating path to final transport position
  - Driving to final transport position (followed by Transporter)
  - Transmitting OK (as arrival at final position)
  - Receiving disconnection
  - Exit tool
