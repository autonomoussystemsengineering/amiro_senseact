====== Transport Follow ======

This tool is the following behavior of the transport scenario, which is described in the [[process:transport:start|transport documentation]]. Basically the robot follows another robot by only using its proximity sensors (have a look into the [[process:actingBehavior:follow_ProximitySensors:start|follow proximity sensors project]]).

===== Building =====

This is a cmake project, so just type:
  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''

===== Basic Functionality in the Scenario =====

  - At beginning the final transport position is initialized by an additional marker
  - "Waiting" (doing some basic behavior)
  - Doesn't get a position any more -> Object has been placed on top of it
  - Calculating path to final transport position
  - Calculating start position in front of it (1 cm distance)
  - Transmitting start position
  - Waiting for recognition from other robot (now called Guide)
  - Transmitting own position
  - Waiting for arrival of Guide
  - Turning towards Guide
  - Transmitting final transport position
  - Doing [[process:actingBehavior:follow_ProximitySensors:start|following behavior]] until Guide arrived final position
  - Transmitting disconnection
  - Exit tool
