====== Simple Object Transport ======

In this task the robot just drives from edge to edge to transport objects:

  - Drive to current table edge
  - Turn to get the table edge direct behind
  - Drive to next table edge
  - Drive a little bit backwards to get distance from table edge
  - Wait for command to repeat

The command can be given via RSB or by using the sensors of the proximity sensor ring.

===== Build Program =====

  - ''cmake .''
  - ''make''

===== RSB Scopes =====

^ Name ^ Default Scope ^ Description ^
| Obstacle Values    | /rir_prox/obstacle   | Inscope for receiving proximity sensor values for obstacle model. |
| Edge Values        | /rir_prox/ground     | Inscope for receiving proximity sensor values for edge model. |
| Command Input      | /tobiamirotable<id>  | Inscope for receiving commands (scope contains AMiRo ID). |
| Answers and Status | /amirotable<id>tobi  | Outscope for sending command answers and status messages (scope contains AMiRo ID). |
| Light Commands     | /amiro/lights        | Outscope for sending light commands. |

===== Commands =====

^ Command Name ^ Command ^ Type ^ Description ^
| Command Input             | "drive"       | String | The robot will start the driving procedure to the next edge. |
| Status Announcement       | "finish"      | String | If the robot is finished with the driving procedure, it will announce it. |
| Command Input Recognition | Command+"rec" | String | If a command has been received, it will be recognized with the addition "rec". |

The Command Input can also be given by the proximity sensors of the proximity sensor ring. In this case two neighboured sensors have to be "touched" for recognition. This feature can be deactivated by program parameter "commandsRSBOnly".
