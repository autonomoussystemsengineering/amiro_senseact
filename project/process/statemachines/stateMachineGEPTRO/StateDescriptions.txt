====== State Behavior Description ======

This is the state behavior description of the [[process:statemachines:stateMachineGEPTRO:start|GEPTRO statemachine]].

===== RSB Connection Types =====

For the communication between the statemachine and the execution program there is used a basic RSB connection. The RSB types, which are used, are different for each communication.

The RSB connection between the statemachine and the external command program is based on the type String. Additionally every command or information has to be repeated until a recognition notice has been received, due to possible lost information via wireless connection.

===== State Behaviors =====

At first the statemachine starts with an initial behavior, which includes exploration and object detection. Afterwards the delivery or transport command can be given by the external command program.

^ Symbol ^ Description ^
| D | Polling RSB connection |
| RS | RSB Answer to polling connection (D) |
| -> | Connection direction |
| -?-> | Expected connection direction |

==== Initial Behavior ====

^ External Command Program ^ ^ Statemachine ^ ^ Execution Program ^
| | -?-> | idle | | |
| "init<Colors>"(D) | -> | idle | | |
| "init"(RS) | <- | init | | |
| | | explorationStart | -> | start exploration task |
| | | exploration | <-?- | do exploration |
| | | exploration | <- | exploration finished |
| | | blobDetection | <- | loading blobs |
| | | objectDetectionStart | -> | start object detection |
| | | objectDetectionInit | <- | count of objects |
| "object<x>"(D) | <- | objectDetectionMain | <- | object <x> detected |
| "object<x>rec"(RS) | -> | objectDetectionMain | | |
| "initDone" | <- | initDone | | |
| | -?-> | waiting | | |


==== Object Delivery Behavior ====

^ External Command Program ^ ^ Statemachine ^ ^ Execution Program ^
| | -?-> | waiting | | |
| "object<Num>"(D) | -> | waiting | | |
| | | objectDeliveryStart | -> | start object delivery |
| "object<Num>start"(RS) | <- | objectDelivery | | |
| | | objectDelivery | <-?- | do delivery |
| | | objectDelivery | <- | object delivery finished |
| "object<Num>finish"(D) | <- | objectDeliveryFinish | <- | object delivery finished |
| "object<Num>finishrec"(RS) | -> | objectDeliveryFinish | | |
| | -?-> | waiting | | |

==== Object Transport Behavior ====

^ External Command Program ^ ^ Statemachine ^ ^ Execution Program ^
| | -?-> | waiting | | |
| "transport"(D) | -> | waiting | | |
| | | objectTransportStart | -> | start object transport |
| "transportstart"(RS) | <- | objectTransport | | |
| | | objectTransport | <-?- | transporting |
| | | objectTransport | <- | object transport finished |
| "transportfinish"(D) | <- | objectTransportFinish | | |
| "transportfinishrec"(RS) | -> | objectTransportFinish | | |
| | -?-> | waiting | | |
