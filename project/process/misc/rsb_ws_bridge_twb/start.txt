====== RSB-WebSockets Bridge ======

This is a generic RSB-WebSockets bridge which offers the following functionality:

  * http(s)/WebSockets webserver functionality using [[https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose|mongoose]] backend (hard linked into the program)
  * Website interface by [[http://www.iui-js.org/|iui]]
  * [[https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/|Protobuffer]] implementation in Javascript by [[https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js/|protobuf.js]]
  * Eye-candy visualization of raw data using [[http://d3js.org/|d3js]]

The main functionality of the program ''rsb_ws_bridge'' is as follows:

  - Offering a html based webside via html
  - On a WebSockets upgrade request by any webbrowser, the webserver assumes to receive an RSB scope
  - A anonymous RSB listener will be created and every received package content (without the RSB layer) will be forwarded to the WebSockets connection
  - The webbrowser receives the raw binary content and needs to know how to interprete it (functionality needs to be programed in javascript inside the webpage).
    * In the case of a Protobuffer message, the content can by interpreted by the webbrowser using protobuf.js
    * In case of a JPEG image, the data can directly displayed as binary blob
    * A nice visual interpretation of raw data can be done via [[http://d3js.org/|d3js]]
    * The big advantage is, that the workload is outsourced to the webbrowser

To see a running demonstration of the webserver, use the demonstration [[demo:webServer:start|webServer]].
