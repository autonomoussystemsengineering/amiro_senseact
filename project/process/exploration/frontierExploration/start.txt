====== Frontier Exploration ======

This program performs a Frontier Exploration.
To do this it requests frontier paths from the [[process:mapping:mapGenerator:start|mapGenerator]] and publishes them to the [[process:exploration:localPlannerISY:start|localPlanner]].
It also implements an edge following. For this purpose steering signals are directly send to [[act:motorControl:start|motorControl]].

===== RSB Scopes =====

^ Scope (default name)      ^ Description ^
|/rir_prox | Inscope for the ring proximity data|
|/prox/floor | Inscope for floor proximity data|
|/murox/roboterlocation | Inscope for the tracking data ("in program spread" --port, --host; id: --id)|
|/pathResponse | Inscope for path responses from the localPlanner (whenever a path is finished)|
|/exploration/command | Inscope for commands from the state machine; any signal on this scope will start the exploration |
|/exploration/answer | Outscope to communicate with the state machine; When the exploration is finished "finish" will be send on this scope |
|/path | Outscope to send paths to the localPlanner|
|/motor/04 | Outscope for steering signals|
|/edgePose | Outscope for edge positions relative to the robot|
|/mapGenerator | Scope of the rsb-server to request paths with the getFrontierPath method|

===== Important Command-Line Options =====
^ Option      ^ Description ^
| -h, --help | Display a help message |
| --id | ID of the tracking marker |
| --host | Spread host |
| --port | Spread port |
| --meterPerPixel | Camera Scaling |
