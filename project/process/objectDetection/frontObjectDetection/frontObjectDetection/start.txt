====== frontObjectDetection ======

This application detects the next object in front of the robot. It always uses the actual frame and the actual proximity sensor values from the [[sense:senseRingProximity:start|senseRingProximity program]]. By giving commands the application can start and stop the object detection or can be quit.

The [[process:objectDetection:frontObjectDetection:frontObjectDetectionCommand:start|Front Object Detection Command]] serves as an interface application for users.

===== Commands =====

For external applications it is possible to send string commands.

^ Key ^ Description ^
| START | Starts the object detection. |
| STOP | Stops the object detection. |

^ Name ^ Type ^ Default scope ^ Description ^
| Image scope | String | /frontObject/image | Scope for sending the camera frame with motion marker (maybe additional the binary motion matrix) if activated (see paramters for activation). |
| Obstacle sensor scope | Vector<int> | /rir_prox/obstacle | Scope for receiving the obstacle proximity sensor values. |
| Command scope | String | /frontObject/command | Scope for receiving commands. |

===== Parameters =====

For parameter information type ''motionDetection -h''.
